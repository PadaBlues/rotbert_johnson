<p>I followed her to the station, with a suitcase in my hand.<br>
And I followed her to the station, with a suitcase in my hand.<br>
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, when all your love's in vain.<br>
All my love's in vain.</p>

<p>When the train rolled up to the station, I looked her in the eye.<br>
When the train rolled up to the station, and I looked her in the eye.<br>
Well, I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome, and I could not help but cry.<br>
All my love's in vain.
</p>
<p>When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind.<br>
When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind.<br>
Well, the blue light was my blues, and the red light was my mind.<br>
All my love's in vain.

Hoo-hoo, ooh, Willie Mae
Oh oh hey, hoo, Willie Mae
Hoo-hoo, ooh, eeh, oh woe
All my love's in vain.
